## Mandy Canales

In the Spring of 2022, theater maker and educator [Mandy Canales](https://) submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr4-port-registry.md) to devise a one-woman-show exploring her learnings from virtual reality theater in VRChat.

### Below The Barracks And Above The Sea

### Spaceholder
Mandy began the [21-Day Challenge]() in the early Summer of 2022 to devise a full format performance using OnBoardXR's asynchronous pipeline for live performance. She began sharing early prototypes and work sessions for an interactive gameshow in the afterlife with plans to mount a performance later in the calendar year. 

### The Constellation Project
Spaceholder was invited and included in the ["`OnBoardXR presents..." Charting The Stars`](./obxr-charting-stars.md) season for Active Replica's Constellation Project and Mandy was joined by VR performers Braden Roy and Leah Sullivan.
