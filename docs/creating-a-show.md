## Join the next Season of Onboard
Our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/qPgbxawu9W) is a place for knowledge sharing, mentorship and support. 

Please remember, this community contains other freelance artists and technologists who are volunteering their time and talent for new performance prototypes and they are not obligated to respond or assist your own creative work. 

As with any online community, we have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech and spam. As a rule, we do not allow unsolicited feedback or criticism.

## Submit A Proposal
We host regular showcase opportunities and hackathons for our community to present new work. This is an open-submission process via a standard application to ensure you understand the tools and procedures for OnBoardXR. A [step-by-step guide to our application](https://discord.com/channels/849041584905388053/957669626408493087/957691545220444300) is on our Discord, otherwise you may [directly access the application here](https://forms.gle/nbnhGV1jp4xgtFQ1A).

## The 21-Day Challenge
In our fifth season, we released [a series of video tutorials](./obxr-21-day-challenge.md) to guide newcomers through the entire OnBoardXR pipeline and toolkit. To date, this series inspired the largest influx of new prototypes and members our community has experienced. This video series will step you through how to develop, build and launch your first virtual reality experience on your own schedule.
