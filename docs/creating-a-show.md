## Join the next Season of Onboard
Our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/qPgbxawu9W) is a place for knowledge sharing, mentorship and support. 

Please remember, this community contains other freelance artists and technologists who are volunteering their time and talent for new performance prototypes and they are not obligated to respond or assist your own creative work. 

As with any online community, we have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech and spam. As a rule, we do not allow unsolicited feedback or criticism.

## The 21-Day Challenge
In our fifth season, we released [a series of video tutorials](./obxr-21-day-challenge.md) to guide newcomers through the entire OnBoardXR pipeline and toolkit.

This video series will step you through how to develop, build and launch your first virtual reality experience on your own schedule.
