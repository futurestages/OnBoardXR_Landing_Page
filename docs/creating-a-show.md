## Join the OnBoardXR Community
Our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/qPgbxawu9W) is a place for knowledge sharing, mentorship and support. 

Please remember, this community contains other freelance artists and technologists who are volunteering their time and talent for new performance prototypes and they are not obligated to respond or assist your own creative work. As with any online community, we have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech and spam. As a rule, we do not allow unsolicited feedback or criticism. 

## Submit A Proposal
We host regular showcase opportunities and hackathons for our community to present new work. This is an open-submission process via a standard application to ensure you understand the tools and procedures for OnBoardXR. A [step-by-step guide to our application](https://discord.com/channels/849041584905388053/957669626408493087/957691545220444300) is on our Discord, otherwise you may [directly access the application here](https://forms.gle/nbnhGV1jp4xgtFQ1A).

## The 21-Day Challenge
In our fifth season, we released [a series of video tutorials](https://discord.com/channels/849041584905388053/957669747472875530/957693244593041418) to guide newcomers through the entire OnBoardXR pipeline and toolkit. To date, this series inspired the largest influx of new prototypes and members our community has experienced. This video series will step you through how to develop, build and launch your first virtual reality experience on your own schedule! 

## Programming Guidelines and Protocols
OnBoardXR offers a glimpse at the exciting potential of the future workforce and creative economy through connecting international artists in a shared mission and collaboration. We are essentially “the thespian society of the metaverse,” a community theater no defined by a single community. 

With any large group of people, there will inevitably arise disagreements or differences in preferences and processes for creation and communication. The following Programming Guidelines and Protocols outlines our expectations from our community members and performances.

1.	Like any online community, we reserve the right to block or kick any member at any time, without warning, for behavior we interpret to be harassment, bullying, hate-speech, predatory, divisive or disruptive to our members. If you're looking for a public space to randomly chat, this community is not intended for that either. We welcome you to return at any time to sincerely engage with our community and content.
2.	OnBoardXR is *not* a producing entity. You are expected to develop and produce your own work as a self-generative artist. We do offer mentorship and 'soft support' through our showcases and sandboxes, however this is a community of volunteers and *no one is obligated to participate or assist in your project or problem*. You are welcome to offer employment, collaboration or inquiry to community members, however we shall interpret any mass or repetitive messaging to solicit/demand our community members' labor (publicly or privately) as a form of harassment and you will be blocked without warning.
3.	Our [Discord Fundamentals](https://discord.com/channels/849041584905388053/882000662798430218/920057393872797736) outline expectations and best practices, primarily to stay within the topic of conversation for each channel; using reactions or GIFs when posting non-essential information; and using sub-theads for lengthy discussions. This allows our text threads to be more efficiently managed by all members and moderators. 
4.	OnBoardXR showcases and team members are under no obligation to include, support, troubleshoot, promote or present your work in their showcases or community, especially if a project is found not to align with our community guidelines or its original application submission. 
5.	Your participation in OnBoardXR is entirely voluntary and subject to your compliance with deadlines and devlierables. As many of OnBoardXR's showcases include the work of multiple artists, we reserve the right to remove any participant whose process or project undermines the performance and/or experience of other artists, audience or OnBoardXR team members.
6.	You must hold the license for any and all materials or assets you present through OnBoardXR showcases and tools. For clarity, this means you are the sole owner and/or creator of all assets, media or materials uploaded or broadcast on OnBoardXR.live or have procured [the appropriate clearance, permissions and licenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pgMtJHg9gg) for such items. 
7.	While we are not creatively prescriptive and have a zero-tolerance policy for unsolicited feedback, we do not accept or program work that violates the United States' Federal Communications Commission's definition of obscene, indecent and profane content. We also reserve the right to reject or remove any content that is perceived to harm, discomfort or disrupt other community members.
8.	OnBoardXR can only offer an abundant culture of knowledge-sharing if its community is the beneficiary of this support. We expect our participants to share your own findings and tools early and often and [properly attribute](https://futurestages.github.io/OnBoardXR_Landing_Page/docs/branding/) the labor and learnings you receive from OnBoardXR by including the name of the OnBoardXR showcase and individuals which supported your prototype in any continued marketing or messaging.
