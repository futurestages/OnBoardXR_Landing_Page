### Emcee and Hosting
Since the inagural OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase, Brendan Bradley has been one of our most frequent and recurring collaborators, gravitating toward our rotating group of Virtual Hosts, often greeting and helping attendees before and during the show, in character as the Pirate Emcee, `"Captain Bradleybeard`", improvising banter and reactions to provide a loose framing for the disconnected Acts and Scenes.
