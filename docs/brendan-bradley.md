# Brendan Bradley
Brendan Andolsek Bradley is known as "America's Scrappy Storyteller" with over 100 film, television, commercial, video game, and interactive projects. Brendan began producing live theater as a teenager and was a part of two successful theater companies in New York City's ["indie theater movement"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_b_4110277) before moving to Los Angeles as an early mover in the ["Web series movement"](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a95e48af407b4331ecb3bf9/1537747912692-IEMOM1XDSMKGT0GRYBFF/Press_Squatters_Backstage_Highlighted.png?format=300w). He began working and developing projects in virtual reality in 2017 and currently serves as the Artistic Director and primary benefactor of OnBoardXR.

### Emcee and Hosting
Since the inagural OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase, Brendan Bradley has been one of our most frequent and recurring collaborators, gravitating toward our rotating group of Virtual Hosts, often greeting and helping attendees before and during the show, in character as the Pirate Emcee, `"Captain Bradleybeard`", improvising banter and reactions to provide a loose framing for the disconnected Acts and Scenes.
