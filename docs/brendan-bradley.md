# Brendan Bradley
Brendan Andolsek Bradley is known as ["America's Scrappy Storyteller"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Bradley_(actor)) with over 100 film, television, commercial, video game, and interactive projects. Brendan began producing live theater as a teenager and was a part of two successful theater companies in New York City's ["indie theater movement"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_b_4110277) before moving to Los Angeles as an early mover in the ["Web series movement"](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a95e48af407b4331ecb3bf9/1537747912692-IEMOM1XDSMKGT0GRYBFF/Press_Squatters_Backstage_Highlighted.png?format=300w). He began working and developing projects in virtual reality in 2017 and co-founded The 5th Wall Forum and OnBoardXR during the 2020 shutdown. Brendan currently serves as the Artistic Director and primary benefactor of OnBoardXR.

### FutureStages
In July of 2020, Brendan Bradley designed and released [`#FutureStages`](./future-stages.md), a free 3D performance space on the web-based virtual reality platform, Mozilla Hubs.

### Jettison
The first prototype production to investigate the viability of live theater in web-based virtual reality, utilizing [`The Future Stages`](./future-stages.md).  The features and techniques used in this production became the underlying inspiration behind the entire OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase and [`cue system`](/OnBoardXR_Landing_Page/docs/cue-system/).
 
### Emcee and Hosting
Since the inagural OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase, Brendan Bradley has been one of our most frequent and recurring collaborators, gravitating toward our rotating group of Virtual Hosts, often greeting and helping attendees before and during the show, in character as the Pirate Emcee, `"Captain Bradleybeard`", improvising banter and reactions to provide a loose framing for the disconnected Acts and Scenes. 

### Non-Player Character
With a 21st-century approach to traditional musical theatre Workshops and Out-Of-Towners, Bradley used virtual and festival performances to experiment with new musical numbers and audience interactions for [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md), a full-format, original Musical in virtual reality.

### The Constellation Pilot
In the Summer of 2022, [`Active Repica`](./active-replica.md) apprached OnBoardXR to serve as the `theater wing` to supply ongoing, live content experiences and offerings, via an ecosystem of interconnected web-based communities. Bradley oversaw and produced 7 experiences within a month.
