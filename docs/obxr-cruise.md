# OnBoardXR Season 1: 'Cruise'
After the success of [Jettison](./jettison.md), the team sought to scale and codify their findings so that any artist could efficiently and economimcally bring their creative practice into web-based virtual reality. A concept emmerged for a [“dark ride”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ride) utilizing Mozilla Hubs’ [`scene-switching`](./glossary-scene-switching) feature to move an audience seemlessly through a variety of virtual worlds and performances offering each act complete control over its enivronment, performance style and audience engagement.

## Production & Sponsors
The Jigsaw Ensemble, Active Replica and Agile Lens formed an informal partnership to produce the event and absorb overhead costs to deploy and host a custom Hubs client on XRTHEATER.LIVE. Roman Miletitch served as Technical Lead supported by David Gochfeld to develop a preliminary [`cue-system`](./glossary-cue-system.md) for triggering theatrical cues in [`web-based virtual reality`](./glossary-webvr.md). 

## Emcees & OnBoarding
A customized version of the [`Future Stages`](./future-stages.md) served as the theater lobby whereby attendees would enter the facade of a traditional playhouse and find themselves on the deck of a cruise ship. Kevin Laibson oversaw house management and user experience with a rotating cast of Emcees interacting and troubleshooting attendees before, during and after the performances. A loosely connected narrative arc was improvised around a group of pirates who had kidnapped the captain of the cruise ship, performed by Dasha Kittredge, Ari Tarr and Brendan Bradley.
