## Virtual Dramaturgy


## Pier To Peer
In the Fall of 2021, Braden Roy and L. Nicol Cabe explored the concept of loosely connecting the cabaret-style acts for OnBoardXR's Mythos and Monsters into a narrative arc. The team worked with `Emcees` [Dasha Kittredge](./dasha-kittredge.md), [Ari Tarr](./ari-tarr.md) and [Tyler Graham](./https://futurestages.github.io/OnBoardXR_Landing_Page/docs/ari-tarr/#haroun-desert--magid) to develop and present a submarine journey to open and close the show, with planned banter and antics between each act.

## It's Pronounced Gybe
L. Nocole Cabe returned for the sixth season of OnBoarXR as field research for documenting and showcasing new storytelling tools in the immersive web.
