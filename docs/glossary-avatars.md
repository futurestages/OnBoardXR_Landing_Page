## Avatars
An `Avatar` is how we refer to [the graphic image that represents a user in the virtual world](https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/what-is-an-avatar-in-the-metaverse/). Every user in the virtual world is represented by a virtual object, comprised of a `3D Mesh,` decorated by `Texture(s)` and a `Rig.` These three components may be customized to allow users to represet themselves in creative ways, however these components must adere to specific technical guidelines to avoid breaking the virtual experience.

- The 3D Mesh is a figure or form of the 3D model. 
- The Texture is the material used to colorize the model.
- The Rig is a platform-specific skeleton that interprets tracking data and expresses those movements on the 3D Mesh.

## Default Avatars
As an open-source platform, Mozilla Hubs offers several default avatars and documentation on quick customizations to re-skin a default avatar.

## Changing & Adding Avatars
A Creator can change or upload their Avatar under the `⋮` menu button and clicking `Change Name and Avatar`. This reveals three libraries for `Featured`, `My Avatars`, and `Newest.` Avatars available to all users appear under `Featured` and must be approved and featured by Admin. Creators may access Avatars they have uploaded under `My Avatars` when signed in using their email address. 

To add an Avatar, a Creator first needs to export their customized Avatar as a .GLB file select `+ Create Avatar` to upload this file. Please check the box for `☐ Allow Promotion` before clicking `Save`. Upon saving, we recommend *right-clicking* on the thumbnail of your newly uploaded avatar and select `Copy Link Address` and saving this URL for future reference.
