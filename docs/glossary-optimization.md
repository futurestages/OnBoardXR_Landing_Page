## Optimization
Many virtual platforms have known limitations for smooth or optimal performance on consumer devices. Below are resources frequently used by OnBoardXR team members to create the most efficient 3D assets. 

## Previewing 3D Assets
It can be difficult to quickly preview or open a 3D file on your computer. These two websites allow you to drag and drop a 3D model for previewing:
- [Don McCurdy's GLTF Viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)
- [BabylonJS Previewer](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/)

## Environment Settings
Mozilla continues to update their Blender Addon for advanced features to optimize lighting, emissives, and environment settings `Scenes`.

## Mixing 2D and 3D Elements
One of our most popular early prototypes was [`Singing Inside a Painting`](https://youtu.be/K7MqCO72hEE?t=77) where a performer individually cut out all the items in a 2D painting and stacked them in 3D space. This use of perspective and low-cost images is also used in [photospheres](./glossary-360.md/#photospheres--hdris) appearing on the horizon of a scene.

By breaking down your `Scene` into areas the audience will or will not interact / travel, 2D elements can work like ["Paper Cut Lightbox](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Lightbox_Papercraft) techniques to make the surrounding area feel more immersive.
