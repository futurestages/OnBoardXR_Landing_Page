# Cue System
## Overview
TBD

## History - Dev With Us
TBD

## Building Cues
### Cue Deployment Server
Cueing data is currently hosted on Firestore and is writable for approved users via [this experimental deployment UI](https://github.com/XHARBOR/ThePortFront-TMP) meant to run locally on your device. Currently, cue building requires you to interface directly with the JSON, but this is only temporary while we work on the cue building interface. Check out the experimental repo for instructions on how to get started and contact michaelhmorran@gmail.com with any questions.
