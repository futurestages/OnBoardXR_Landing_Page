## Production & Sponsors
**The Jigsaw Ensemble and Active Replica** continued their informal partnership to produce the event and absorb overhead costs. Michael Morran stepped up as Techincal Director and Stage Manager to expand the [`cue system`](./cue-system.md) with experimental features intended for [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md) and organized a [`Paper Tech`](./cue-system.md/#paper-tech) system for all participants to submit a cue sheet without learning javascript. Participants submitted prototype proposals via an open-submission process, however the season was saturated primarily by returning participants which cultivated a stronger sense of community and collaboration.

## Emcees & OnBoarding
Our `Pirate Emcees` helped greet and troubleshoot attendees prior to showtime, performed by [`Dasha Kittredged`](./dasha-kittredge.md), [`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md), and [`Tyler Graham`](./tyler-graham.md). In an experiment for narrative dramaturgy, the pre-show transitioned into the first Act of the actual event.

## [Cue System](./cue-system.md)
[`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md) took over Technical Direction and Stage Management as part of his engagement on [Non-Player Character](./non-player-character.md), bringing new features, like `grouped cues` and `avatar manipulation` to the [`cue system`](./cue-system.md) and introducing his own [`Paper Tech`]() workflow to allow Creators without coding experience to complete a Google Sheet with the data fields necessary to develop theatrical cues on behalf of another Creator. 

## Reception & Analysis
The third OnBoardXR had double the attendance of previous seasons with more tickets “sold” prior to the opening show than total attendance of any other OnBoardXR series. Almost half the audience attended in [`standalone HMD`](./glossary-hmd.md) with a healthy 5% still on mobile phone or tablet. Even with repeat customers, 25% of attendees reported the show as their first ever vitual reality or live virtual reality experience. This increased to 50% when we include attendees who reported only having ever attended *one* live virtual reality performance prior to OB3. Our partnership with an existing festival, like FIVARS, appeared to assist this metric, with participants naming blogs or publications as how they learned about OnBoardXR. 

One hundred percent of attendees chose to pay *something* for their ticket, with FIVARS attendees showing the willingness to pay $45 for a festival badge and two of our own audience members electing to pay $50 and $100 respectively. Overall,  1/4th of our audience was comfortable paying $15+ for the show, with a total average of $12.15 per ticket. 

Many participants and attendees noted the elevated experience, crediting the familarness and supportiveness of return creators and the support from active team members like [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md) and [`Anais Ron`](./active-replica.md) to assist in programming and design.
