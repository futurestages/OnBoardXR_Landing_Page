# Future Stages
In July of 2020, [`Brendan Bradley`](./brendan-bradley.md) designed and released [a free 3D performance space](https://www.playbill.com/article/can-this-game-changing-innovation-get-live-theatre-back-before-the-pandemic-ends) on the web-based virtual reality platform, Mozilla Hubs. Bradley referred to the project as #FutureStages and personally provided tutorials and support for dozens of artists and institutions to customize the experience to create and monetize their own live performance events during the pandemic. 

The immediate impact and scalbility of offering a free-and-open tool for live performance on the immersive web influenced the original creative community and culture of OnBoardXR.

## HERE Festival
The first prototype of [`Jettison`](./jettison.md) was presented at The HERE Festival in October 2020 and became the groundwork for the inaugural [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md) Showcase. 

## Black Revolutionary Theater Workshop
Heather Harvey of [BRTW in Brooklyn connected with Bradley to further optimize the experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=3W50g6jwpKI&t=156s) for primarily mobile device attendees and were able to continue their 'Melanated Mondays' series throughout the shutdown.

## The 5th Wall Forum
During the shutdown, a collective of storytelling proffesionals co-founded [The 5th Wall Forum](https://www.5thwallforum.com/podcast) with a Kickoff Event and Reveal Incubator. During the December 2020 Kickoff, Bradley led a *Bring Your Production Virtual* workshop and panel inside The Future Stages with a dozen participants while broadcasting in 2D to several hundred spectators over Zoom.

## Actors Theatre of Louisville
The Actors Theatre of Louisville incorporated the Future Stages tools to customize a 3D model of their own theater in Mozilla Hubs for the [Professional Training Company](https://www.actorstheatre.org/blog/tags/Professional%20Training%20Company)'s 2020 Showcase. ATL continued ground breaking explorations in virtual reality with OnBoardXR community member, Alex Coulombe. 

## Museum of Science, Boston
The Subspace Adult Programming of The Museum of Science in Boston connected with Bradley to create and perform [a one-man-show showcasing the tools and technology behind the Future Stages](https://playbill.com/article/watch-this-live-virtual-reality-theatre-performance-from-the-museum-of-science).  

## University of Southern Mississippi
Students at USM pushed the Future Stages tutorials to the bleeding edge, staging multiple performances using mixed media, augmented and virtual reality.
