## Future Stages
In July of 2020, Brendan Bradley designed and released [a free 3D performance space](https://www.playbill.com/article/can-this-game-changing-innovation-get-live-theatre-back-before-the-pandemic-ends) on the web-based virtual reality platform, Mozilla Hubs. Bradley referred to the project as #FutureStages and personally provided tutorials and support for dozens of artists and institutions to customize the experience to create and monetize their own live performance events during the pandemic. 

## The 5th Wall Forum
During the shutdown, Bradley became one of the founding members of The 5th Wall Forum and produced their Kickoff and Reveal Events. During the December 2020 Kickoff, Bradley led a Bring Your Production Virtual workshop and panel inside The Future Stages with a dozen participants while broadcasting in 2D to several hundred spectators over Zoom. 

## Black Revolutionary Theater Workshop
Heather Harvey of [BRTW in Brooklyn connected with Bradley to further optimize the experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=3W50g6jwpKI&t=156s) for primarily mobile device attendees and were able to continue their 'Melanated Mondays' series throughout the shutdown.

## Actors Theatre of Louisville
The Actors Theatre of Louisville connected with Bradley to incorporate the Future Stages principles and tools to customize a 3D model of their own theater in Mozilla Hubs for the [Professional Training Company](https://www.actorstheatre.org/blog/tags/Professional%20Training%20Company)'s 2020 Showcase. ATL continued ground breaking explorations in virtual reality with OnBoardXR community member, Alex Coulombe. 

## Museum of Science, Boston
The Subspace Adult Programming of The Museum of Science in Boston connected with Bradley to create and perform [a one-man-show showcasing the tools and technology behind the Future Stages](https://playbill.com/article/watch-this-live-virtual-reality-theatre-performance-from-the-museum-of-science).  

## University of Southern Mississippi
Bradley was delighted to be contacted by students at USM who had pushed his own tutorials to the bleeding edge and wanted to go further. Bradley virtually consulted and workshopped with students as they staged multiple performances using mixed media, augmented and virtual reality.
