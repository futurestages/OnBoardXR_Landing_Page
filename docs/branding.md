## OnBoardXR Branding & Style Guide
OnBoardXR represents an open, living community and sandbox for self-generative contributors in the spirit of the [Homebrew Computer Club]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) with a specific focus on live, experimental performing arts/events in the [‘immersive web’](). 

Our early productions and onboarding practices were nautically themed and celebrated a ‘hacker’ approach to storytelling. Early creators organically adopted a *“pirate”* and *"playful and punk"* identity and Emcees often greeted guests in playful pirate accents and avatars. As OnBoardXR became known as a safe space to celebrate and support unpolished, boundary-pushing avant garde, the nautical and pirate iconography became integrated into our brand identity as variations on a skull and crossbones. 

The accent goldenrod yellow (hexcode: ) is an homage to the color palette found in both our primary origins: the VR community’s [Mozilla Hubs yellow duck](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-branding.html) and the theater community’s iconic [Playbill yellow banner](https://playbill.com/article/how-to-build-your-own-custom-playbill-program-with-playbillder). 

All participants and attendees of OnBoardXR are requested to use the hashtags #OnBoardXR and #OBXR when referencing the brand or experience(s).

When possible, please include our url http://OnBoardXR.org in all posts and releases.


## Attribution
Many of our prototypes and artists have successfuly received funding or opportunity after support from OnBoardXR. Simultaneously, OnBoardXR submits all its prototypes for festival and awards consideration. In keeping with our mission, we believe in proper attribution for all investment(s) made by our community and team, often offering the first or only path to production for artists to bring their creative practice into virtual reality. 

This is not disimilar to the typical first-production acknowledgement when a work of theater is published and empowers all participants to leverage the full weight and legacy of the OnBoardXR brand to elevate their personal projects. 

If OnBoardXR receives an award or nomination for a seasonal showcase that included your work, we welcome you to include any laurels or logos of the award on your own show marketing with the added attribtuion *"as part of OnBoardXR"*. Pleas see an example below:
