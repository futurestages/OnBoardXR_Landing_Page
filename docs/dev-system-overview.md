# Cue System History
OnBoardXR is perhaps most recognized for it's support, development and experimentation for theatrical cueing in web-based virtual reality. This is a messaging system delivering `cues` or packets of javascript to the multi-user experience to trigger changes in scenery, avatars, objects, lighting and more. 

## Code Injection
In 2020, we staged an original prototype of a short play 'Jettison' in [Mozilla Hubs](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs). Roman Miletich, David Gochfeld and Alex Coulombe experimented with pre-scripted commands that could be copy-and-pasted into the developer console of one user's web brower and update all networked devices, also known as `injecting` javascript. This method allowed for simple triggers to:
- raise and lower a video
- change actor avatars
- play music and sound effects
