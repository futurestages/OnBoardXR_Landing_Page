## Jettison
The first prototype production from producers Brendan Bradley, Alex Coulombe, David Gochfeld, Kevin Laibson and Roman Miletitch to investigate the viability of live theater in web-based virtual reality, utilizing ['The Future Stages'](./future-stages.md)

## Background
*Jettison* is a one act play by Brendan Bradley about three strangers stranded in a life boat who discover a rabbit. The dark comedy was originally commissioned and produced by Impetuous Theater Group as part of the [2007 Swim Shorts 3](https://www.theateronline.com/pb.xzc?PK=16050) in the rooftop swimming pool of the Midtown Manhattan Holiday Inn. The play was subsequently published in [One Acts of Note](https://www.amazon.com/Acts-Note-David-Miguel-Estrada/dp/0578018365) and produced at The Adrienne Arsht Center as part of The Signature Shorts Series in 2008.

The play received critcism as an 'unproduceable work of theater' given the challenges of an ocean environment, a live animal, and an on-stage drowning. 

## HERE Festvial
Alex Coulombe, David Gochfeld and Kevin Laibson approaced Brendan Bradley about their previous work in virtual reality with an interest to investigate the viability of live theater in web-based virtual reality, utilizing ['The Future Stages'](./future-stages.md). Throughout the global shutdown, the team remotely workshopped and remimagined the play to determine if the affordances of virtual reality and the immersive web could resolve the previous critcisms of the play. The play was presented at No Proscenium's HERE Festival in two different modalities with the actors performing once via their webcams composited into a single video and second as virtual avatars. The production was the subject of a short-form documentary.
