## Jettison
The first prototype production from producers Brendan Bradley, Alex Coulombe, David Gochfeld, Kevin Laibson and Roman Miletitch to investigate the viability of live theater in web-based virtual reality, utilizing ['The Future Stages'](./future-stages.md)

## Background
*Jettison* is a one act play by Brendan Bradley about three strangers stranded in a life boat who discover a rabbit. The dark comedy was originally commissioned and produced by Impetuous Theater Group as part of the [2007 Swim Shorts 3](https://www.theateronline.com/pb.xzc?PK=16050) in the rooftop swimming pool of the Midtown Manhattan Holiday Inn. The play was subsequently published in [One Acts of Note](https://www.amazon.com/Acts-Note-David-Miguel-Estrada/dp/0578018365) and produced at The Adrienne Arsht Center as part of The Signature Shorts Series in 2008.

The play received critcism as an 'unproduceable work of theater' given the challenges of an ocean environment, a live animal, and an on-stage drowning. 

## Webcam versus Avatar Performance 
Alex Coulombe, David Gochfeld and Kevin Laibson approached Brendan Bradley about their previous work in virtual reality with an interest to investigate the viability of live theater in web-based virtual reality, utilizing ['The Future Stages'](./future-stages.md). Throughout the global shutdown, the team remotely workshopped and remimagined the play to determine if the affordances of virtual reality and the immersive web could resolve the previous critcisms of the play. 

The team elected to limit their asset design to default and/or creative commons 3D models and avatars as a proof of concept for what any artist could replicate with a budget or bespoke 3D modeling. 

Actors Nican Robinson, Nick Carrillo, Ashley Clements and Brendan Bradley attended rehearsals and performances from three different cities courtesy of Pico Neo 2 headsets provided by LBX Immersive. The play was presented at No Proscenium's HERE Festival in two different modalities with the actors performing once via their webcams composited into a single video and second as virtual avatars. 

## Theater Cues in VR
Throughout rehearsals and performances of Jettison, the team began to explore 'injecting' javascript into the web browser's developer console to force events and features that were not part of Mozilla Hubs. This included, spawning and animating objects, raising and lowering a curtain and triggering lighting and audio cues. Roman Miletitch, David Gochfeld and Alex Coulombe organized a series of code packets that could copy-and-pasted when they wished to deploy a specific cue event. 

This method established the groundwork for creating pre-determined snippets of code that could be deployed on command, organzied in a graphicical interaface that only the stage manager could access. 

## Reception
The VR production of Jettison was a Finalist for The Producer Guild of America's Innovation Award and was the subject of a short-form documentary. The team was invited to present their findings at Microsoft, AMC-SIGGRAPH and VRâ€¢NY. Jettison's underlying principles for simulating the real-world theatregoing experience in virtual reality continue to inform and influence OnBoardXR's practices regarding prototyping, house management, audience onboarding, theatrical cues and artist management.
