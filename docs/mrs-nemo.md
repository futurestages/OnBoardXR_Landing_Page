## Mrs. Nemo

In the Fall of 2021, [Mary Stuart David]() and [David Gochfeld]() submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](/obxr3-mythos-monsters) as an initial project to develop a short-form immersive musical inspired by [Sally Swain’s Great Housewives of Art](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Housewives-Art-Sally-Swain/dp/0586205306) and Jules Verne’s character of Captain Nemo in [20,000 Leagues under the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas).

### DC Labs
OnBoardXR offered a pipeline and platform for the team of PhD students and researchers from University of York’s DC Labs to explore staging a theatrical work in browser-based virtual reality.

This team brought the rare advantage of their own independent financial, design, and narrative resources to their prototype allowing OnBoardXR’s community to focus on knowledge sharing and stabilizing the integration of:
1. Music sync in virtual reality (similar to [`Jettison`]() and [`Non-Player Character`]()), allowing the solo perfomer. [Vivian Belosky]() to sing live with a backing track; and 
2. Developments to the [`external cueing system`]() from [Michael Morran](), [Roman Miletitch]() and [David Gochfeld]() which allowed spawning and animating multiple objects throughout the live performance. 

The most compelling application of the cueing system was a “Kraken attack” in the story, where [`“grouped cues”`]() allowed multiple animated objects to be triggered in succession by clicking on a single button on the stage manager’s graphic user interface.

### Mrs. Nemo Remount
The team released an [abstract on their experience collaborating on Mrs. Nemo with OnBoardXR]((https://thewritingplatform.com/2022/05/the-making-of-an-immersical/) and initially concluded they wished to explore alternative social vr platforms to expand the piece. In the Summer of 2022, the team requested support to reprise Mrs. Nemo using OnBoardXR’s codebase and sponsor server to present at an academic conference. 

OnBoardXR is delighted by the success of Mrs. Nemo as the first in a series of musicals from this team that aim to retell episodes from Victorian literature from an imaginary wife’s perspective using virtual reality storytelling tools and technology.
