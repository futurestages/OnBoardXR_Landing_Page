## Rooms
A `Room` is how we refer to unique instance (URL) of a 3D environment whereby multiple users can join simultaneously and occupy the same virtual space. 

## Creating a Room
A Creator can generate a new Room at any time by opening their [`Scene Link`](./glossary-scene.md/#scene-links) and clicking the `Create a Room with this Scene` blue button in the center of the screen. A Room can also be generated in the Scene's [`Spoke Project`](./glossary-scene.md/#spoke) by clicking the `Open in Hubs` blue button in the top right of the Spoke Project.

## Settings
The creator of a `Room` can change the room settings, under the `⋮` menu button and clicking `Room Info and Settings.` In the top right, there will appear an option to `Edit` the settings, including the room Name, Description, Capacity and Permissions.

## Promotion
If a `Room` settings are limited, only the creator of a room will have admin priviledges. This can often include the ability to interact with objects spawned from the [`cue system`](./cue-system.md). Before each event, all team members should join the room to all the original creator of the room to select `People` in the top right overlay, click each team member's username and `Promote` the user to have full permissions. A user has been successfully promoted when a `☆` appears next to their username.
