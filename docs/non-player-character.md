# Non-Player Character
A hybrid, interactive musical theater production where a live, singing actor portrays a non-player character ('NPC') in a fictional video game who witnesses the death of the Hero character and turns to the audience to guide them through the fives stages of grief (represented as five virtual worlds). 

With a 21st-century approach to the tradition of musical theater Workshops and Out-Of-Towners, Bradley uses the virtual festival circuit to experiment with new musical numbers and audience interactions, appearing live at FIVARS, Mozilla Festival, Augmented World Expo, and winning Best in VR Interactive Immersive Experience at The Queensland (Qld) XR Festival on the path to present the first prototype performance at The Museum of Science in Boston. 

## Background
During the 2020 shutdown, Bradley live-streamed [a one-man show, showcasing five modes of virtual storytelling](https://playbill.com/article/watch-this-live-virtual-reality-theatre-performance-from-the-museum-of-science) for The Museum of Science, including live theater in [web-based virtual reality](./glossary-webvr). The following year, Bradley was invited to write and perform an interactive musical theater prototype, [Non-Player Character](), at [The Mugar Omni Dome Theater](https://www.mos.org/press/press-releases/Adult-Programming-Fall-2021) allowing on-site audiences to enter either as a Participant in the VR Concert wearing a VR headset or a Spectator of the virtual experience projected on [the IMAX dome screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugar_Omni_Theater). In hopes of making the experience accessible to as many people as possible, Bradley was asked to limit the prototype to a 15-minute "show loop" he could perform consecutively for 4 hours. Audiences could choose to experience one short loop or watch multiple versions to observe the variability of game play style and audience interactions.

## NPC: Story Structure & Development
Bradley began devising Non-Player Character in January of 2021 and sketched a few songs and characters for solo rehearsal and writing sessions. Based on his experience performing in live virtual reality projects like *Jettison*, *OnBoardXR* and *Welcome to Respite*, Bradley wished to further investigate the responsive role of "Actor-Guide," theorizing that this relationship with the audience could be inverted by portraying a character without any agency who relied upon attendees to navigate him through open-world environments. The early writing of NPC became most satisfying to Bradley while balancing the tension of two dualing formats: 
- [Long-form Improvisational formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre#Non-comedic,_experimental,_and_dramatic,_narrative-based_improvisational_theater) similar to [talk radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio) where Hosts allow the audience to call-in and influence the show with unpredictable reactions that range from comical to heartbreaking;
- [A Book Musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre#Book_musicals) format whereby the performer can command complete control of the story and audience through well-rehearsed, emotionally resonate song, stage craft and spectacle. 
Early workshops of Non-Player Character centered around this ebb and flow of participation and performance. 

### NPC: 'Let's Get To The Bottom Of This'
Bradley hired [Michael Morran](./michael-morran.md) as a Technical Director to explore and stablize features they both hoped to bring to the OnBoardXR [cue-system](./cue-system.md) using Non-Player Character as a prototype. For [OnBoardXR: Mythos and Monsters](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md) they presented a first musical number *'Let's Get To The Bottom Of This'* wherein the audience encountered Bradley portraying a singing octopus [avatar](./glossary-avatar) in an open ocean environment, simulating "swimming" by using the "fly" mechanic and inviting audience to banter with Bradley and sing-a-long.  

This superficially simple and silly musical performance helped stabilize and showcase [cue-grouping](./glossary-cue-group.md), [god-mic](./glossary-god-mic.md), [avatar manipulation](./glossary-avatar-manipulation.md) and further [virtual cable](./glossary-virtual-cable.md) integration, all of which were made available to the other participants of [OnBoardXR: Mythos and Monsters](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md) and [OnBoardXR: Port of Registry](./obxr-port-of-registry).

*'Let's Get To The Bottom Of This'* was presented for the general public and an official selection of FIVARS 2021 Festival as presented by OnBoardXR.

### NPC: Early Playtesting
In anticiption of the prototype performance at The Mugar Omni Theater, Bradley and Morran began running the entire show loop daily. Bradley would drop off a kit of [virtual reality headsets](./hmd.md) and instructions to friends, sanitizing and charging them between deliveries. Then he would return home to perform the live experience and receive feedback. These virtual "previews" drastically influenced and identified last-minute changes to the narrative, asset design and user experience. 

### NPC: Prototype Performance at The Mugar Omni Theater
Non-Player Character performed 8 consecutive loops in The Museum of Science's omni dome theater for dozens of active participants and spectators. A videographer recorded the entire event and highlights from various loops were edited into an archive that may be privately screened for funding and awards consideration.
