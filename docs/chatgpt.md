# Chat GPT
Before the hype cycle of generative art and text, Brendan Bradley invited Isak Keller to join [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md) in early 2021 to present '[The Play That Is Going To Change Everything](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/1132152/play-going-change-everything-worlds-first-play-generated-gpt-3-most-sophisticated-text),' written entirely using ChatGPT-3's Beta. 

## Background
Keller [detailed his process of generating the play](https://twitter.com/IsakKeller/status/1537466540508987395?s=20) to be released initially as a podcast and receiving its first workshop production with the innagural OnBoardXR. *"Once I get into GPT-3’s early access, like many I’m using different mismatched characters from pop culture, history, etc...I’m a big Theatre guy and have always kind of hated theatre’s aversion to technology. I thought that trying to push a sort of inherently soulless AI in the direction of the worlds oldest art form, something all about human connection and empathy was a fun juxtaposition...I “find out” that if you give it some stage directions or a setting and then prompt a character to speak with “CHARACTER NAME:” it will generally give you decent dialogue, in a sort of scripted style. Of course all depending on your prompt...I find a good prompt. I’m getting amazing dialogues, I can’t believe I’m just pressing the enter button over and over with this prompt and generating gold, every time...I realize that I’m saving all of these generations on a google doc and that they’re going to become a play.The prompt in question?

>“SpongeBob and Patrick are smoking weed and discussing philosophy and how it affects their lives in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom. They’re pretty stoned. Like they’re almost greening out but somehow staying lucid.”

## Workshop Production
Isak Keller enlists a team of New York actors, none of whom own or have access to virtual reality equipment. They rehearse and perform the play entirely using their keyboards and mice to "puppet" the characters, relying heavily on voiceover and a Narrator-Guide.
