# Cinematics

## Origin
The prototype of [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md) was performed at The Mugar Omni Dome Theater allowing on-site audiences to enter either as a Participant in the VR Concert wearing a VR headset or a Spectator of the virtual experience projected on an [IMAX dome screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugar_Omni_Theater). During virtual performances, users could freely move their POV around the virtual space to follow the action of the story, however the seated Spectators on-site would not have control over the projection on the big screen. 

## Cinema Role
Using traditional theater [blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(stage)) and direction, the team mapped out exactly where the performer's avatar would appear in the space during each moment of the live show. Utilizing [Michael Morran](./michael-morran.md)'s feature for [`avatar manipulation`]() a [`Role`](./glossary-roles.md) of `Cinematographer` was created and animated along a pre-determined path, triggered with existing [`grouped cues`]() from the show. The POV of the `Cinematographer`'s avatar was projected on-screen for the Spectators, appearing as traditional camera movements in an animated film, seemingly in sync with the action of th story.

When we were approached by [`The WebXR Awards Live Halftime Show`](the-polys-halftime-show/) to produce and perform in social vr without interupting their broadcast of presenters and pre-recorded videos, we provided them the credentials for this 'Cinema Role' to join our [`Room`](./glossary-rooms.md) and experience a hands-free "ride" through the performance, screen-captured for their OBS Livestream Broadcast. 

## Cinema Mode
The advantage of virtual reality storytelling is often the ability to give the audience agency over the story and journey. Therefore it can be difficult to predict how users will navigate through the space. Utilizing [`MattBCool's Waypoint System`](./glossary-waypoint.md/#audience-recall), the [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md) team experimented with adding [`Waypoints`](./glossary-waypoint.md) to various locations on the Performer's [`Avatar`](./glossary-avatars.md), allowing the 'Cinema Role' to be attached to a releative position and "follow" the Performer - simulating [`3rd Person`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_camera_system#Third-person_view) and [`Selfie`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie) point-of-view which can be triggered on-demand.
