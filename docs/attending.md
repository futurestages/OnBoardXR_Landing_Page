## On-stage ticket
*A Virtual On-Stage Seat allows our most “active attendees” to enjoy all the affordances of virtual reality, essentially sitting on the actual stage and being engaged and acknowledged by the performers. Often events are designed to give these users agency to effect the action and narrative through verbal improvisation or physical tasks.*

## Orchestra ticket
*A Virtual Orchestra Seat denotes a “casual participant” who wishes to attend co-presently but separated from the performers. This method of viewing is collequially referred to as ghost mode based on the earliest 360 and VR performance where attendees were not embodied and could not interact with the content. This method is used across platforms and projects to scale experiences designed for intimate encounters. This experience simulates the orchestra section of commercial live productions offering “the best seat in the house” without breaking the “fourth wall.”*

## Refunds
[`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) likes to say *"we are navigating the uncharted waters of the metaverse and things may get a bit choppy."* If your experience is unpleasant or interrupted, we understand you may wish to request a refund and are happy to receive these requests at: info (at) jigsawensemble (dot) com 
However, we ask that you consider that every dollar of ticket sales is split between our participants to support their prototyping at the bleeding edge of what is possible. We hope you'll consider leaving your donation in the future of live performing arts on the immersive web and instead request a complimentary ticket to a later showtime.
