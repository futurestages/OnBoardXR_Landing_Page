## What Is An OnBoardXR Performance?
OnBoardXR supports live 3D events in your web browser. Your ticket link offers access to a multi-user virtual world where you may interact with live performers and other attendees either in our seasonal showcase of several short-form prototypes or a singular longer-format mainstage event. The artists and programs at OnBoardXR are known for being at the bleeding edge of the emerging live virtual reality industry, celebrating early experiments and rough edges. 

## What Equipment Do I Need?
OnBoardXR utilizes web-based virtual reality, also known as “social VR” or “WebXR” built upon the open-source client, [Mozilla Hubs. (You can learn more about that platform here.)](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/welcome.html) This allows (almost) any web connected device to enter a 3D virtual environment as a multi-player experience with other attendees represented as 3D [avatars](./glossary-avatars.md) and/or [web cameras](./glossary-webcam.md). This means our creators and audience do not require *any* special equipment to join our virtual experience.

## Ticket Link
Tickets are often available via [Everything Immersive](https://everythingimmersive.com/events/onboard) as a Pay-What-You-Want donation, currently averaging $15 across all attendees and $25+ for active participants. 

Before your showtime, you should receive an email with a **unique url** to access the live experience. You may type this url into your web connected device to access your performance between 30 and 5 minutes before showtime.

## Refunds
[`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) likes to say *"we are navigating the uncharted waters of the metaverse and things may get a bit choppy."* If your experience is unpleasant or interrupted, we understand you may wish to request a refund and are happy to receive these requests at: info (at) jigsawensemble (dot) com 
However, we ask that you consider that every dollar of ticket sales is split between our participants to support their prototyping at the bleeding edge of what is possible. We hope you'll consider leaving your donation in the future of live performing arts on the immersive web and instead request a complimentary ticket to a later showtime.
