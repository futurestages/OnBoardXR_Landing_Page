## What Is An OnBoardXR Performance?
OnBoardXR supports live 3D events in your web browser. Your ticket link offers access to a multi-user virtual world where you may interact with live performers and other attendees either in our seasonal showcase of several short-form prototypes or a singular longer-format mainstage event. The artists and programs at OnBoardXR are known for being at the bleeding edge of the emerging live virtual reality industry, celebrating early experiments and rough edges. 

## What Equipment Do I Need?
OnBoardXR utilizes web-based virtual reality, also known as “social VR” or “WebXR” built upon the open-source client, [Mozilla Hubs. (You can learn more about that platform here.)](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/welcome.html) This allows (almost) any web connected device to enter a 3D virtual environment as a multi-player experience with other attendees represented as 3D [`avatars`](./glossary-avatars.md) and/or [`web cameras`](./glossary-webcam.md). This means our creators and audience do not require *any* special equipment to join our virtual experience.

### VR Controllers
[Please find a list of controls for different VR devices on Mozilla's blog](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-controls.html)

### Mobile Controls
On mobile devices, two circles will appear on the bottom of your screen to simulate joysticks. The left joystick tilts your point-of-view or "head" to "look around." The right joystick "walks" your avatars through the space. 

### User Interface
We have added two overlays for Information and Troubleshooting. The (i) button will give you information about the performance, colloquially referred to as the programme or plabill. 

## Refunds
[`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) likes to say *"we are navigating the uncharted waters of the metaverse and things may get a bit choppy."* If your experience is unpleasant or interrupted, we understand you may wish to request a refund and are happy to receive these requests at: info (at) jigsawensemble (dot) com 
However, we ask that you consider that every dollar of ticket sales is split between our participants to support their prototyping at the bleeding edge of what is possible. We hope you'll consider leaving your donation in the future of live performing arts on the immersive web and instead request a complimentary ticket to a later showtime.
