# OnBoardXR presents...'Charting the Stars'
When [Active Replica](./active-replica.md) launched a pilot of ‘The Constellation Project’ to connect multiple private communities using their own Mozilla Hubs Cloud instances to share each other’s live events/experiences, they asked OnBoardXR to serve as their “theater wing.” 

This opportunity allowed us to test an "OnBoardXR presents..." model of supporting asynchronous creatorship in the immersive web beyond the protoype or hackathon stage and provide support for a repertory of singular [`“mainstage”`]() productions from previous OnBoardXR participants. For clarity, this event was *not* an open-submission presentation of new works and therefore not in keeping with the culture and format of a traditional OnBoardXR showcase. Therefore, we used the branding of [`'Charting The Stars'`]() to represent the events as highlights of the last year of creatorship wthin our community.

The creators and initiative were features in a series of Creator Blogs to inspire and empower other creative artists interested in immersive web technologies. 

## Production & Sponsors
Brendan Bradley served as a liason and coordinator between Active Replica and individual creators, who maintained complete control and ownership over their content, schedule and ticketing. This experience can be best compared to a gallery residency/installation where an artist is commissioned to have free reign over a venue during a set window of time to explore their personal process with elevated support and resources. These works are self-generative with design and marketing support from Active Replica. Shows will be made available to Active Replica's broader ecosystem of clients to test The Consteallation Project's objective for portalling and messaging between multiple webVR instances regarding live events. This will appear in-world with portal at each community hub, advertising the upcoming three events in a "billboard" and a portal that will instantly take users to an active event across the network.

## [Cue System](./glossary-cue-system.md)
The OnBoardXR [`cue system`] was merged with proprietary code from [`Active Replica`] to enable portalling and cross-community notifications for the pilot period. Creators were able to access and modify their existing cue database on our GitHub organization without accdientally altering the codebase for the overall experience. The [`Sponsor Lobby`] from our third season was updated and hosted on [XRTHEATER.LIVE](https://XRTHEATER.LIVE) with posters for each Artist linking to the primiary environment of each Show. This allowed attendees of one performance to learn and explore the other content offerings of the entire ecosystem. 

## Reception & Analysis
