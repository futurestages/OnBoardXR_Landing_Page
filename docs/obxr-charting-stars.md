# OnBoardXR presents...'Charting the Stars'
When [Active Replica]() wished to pilot ‘The Constellation Project’ to connect multiple private communities using their own Mozilla Hubs Cloud instances to share each other’s live events/experiences, they asked OnBoardXR to serve as their “theater wing.” This opportunity provided support for a repertory of singular “Mainstage” productions from previous OnBoardXR participants, including [Ari Tarr](./active-replica.md), [Mandy Carnales](./mandy-carnales.md), [Naomi Smyth](./naomi-smyth.md), [Koryn Wicks](./koryn-wicks.md) and more. However, due to the lack of a combined showcase and open-submission process, this event was not in keeping with the culture and format of an OnBoardXR showcase. The partnership aims to explore the opportunity for an "OnBoardXR presents..." model of supporting asynchronous creatorship in the immersive web beyond the protoype or hackathon stage.

## Production & Sponsors
The Constellation Project is overseen entirely by Active Replica with individual creators maintaining complete control and ownership over their content, schedule and ticketing. This experience is most comparable to a gallery installation where an artist is commissioned to have free reign over a venue during a set window of time to explore their personal process with elevated support and resources. These works are entirely self-generative and shall be made available of Active Replica's broader network as content offerings within their active network.
