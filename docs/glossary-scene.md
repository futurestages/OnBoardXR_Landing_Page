## Scenes
A `Scene` is how we refer to 3D worlds or environments designed and published by our Creators. Effectively, this is the customizeable "Stage Area" for our Creators to rehearse and perform their work in virtual reality. Scenes function similary to a website template in establishing the layout and design of the virtual experience.
