# Active Replica

For [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md), a Canadian immersive company, [`Active Replica`](), was introduced to the team via performer [`Xriel Tarr`]() to offer Technical support to deploy a custom client of Mozilla Hubs at XRtheater.live and Design suppport for 3D assets. 

## Sponsorship 

Active Replica's [`Jacob Ervin`]() and [`Valerian`]() supported OnBoardXR with [In-Kind Sponsorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifts_in_kind) for [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md), [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md), and [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md). This [`"soft support"`](./glossary-soft-support.md) included maintaining XRtheater.live as a test-server for deploying webVR features or prototypes that may have disrupted Active Replica's primary business on their company server and limited staff support by [`Anais Ron`]() to help enhance and optimize certain visual assets, [`Stephen Flach`]() for early stage management and [`Paola`]() for livestreaming the events to a secondary streaming partner.  

During [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md), Active Replica provided a 3D Lobby-Aquarium [`Scene`](./glossary-scene.md), which became known as [`The Sponsor Lobby`]() and showcased the company's standout design capability. 

During [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md), Active Replica offered to include a modest fiscal sponsorship to help OnBoardXR's overhead costs and allow ticket sales to continue to be split amoung OnBoardXR participants.

## MozFest: A Case-Study in Interoperable Metaverses

Unbeknownst to either party, [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md) applied and was accepted into Mozilla Festival (known as 'MozFest') as Active Replica was tapped to design and host the Festival's virtual campus. 

This campus aimed to connect multiple custom clients of Mozilla Hubs so users could "portal" between different experiences. As a case study for interoperable metaverses, MozFest granted Active Replica permission to incorporate OnBoardXR's lobby directly into the virtual conference itself as a dedicated "wing." Participants of the conferece could visit the OnBoardXR lobby by clicking on a doorway which linked to a [`Room`](./glossary-room.md) url on OnBoardXR's separate server. This mirrored the exact mechanic of portaling into breakout rooms within the virtual conference itself, with a minor inconvenience of requiring the user to repeat the sign-in menu process.

During showtimes, participants could join the live performance by navigating the to theater wing and clicking on the doorway. After the performance, attendees could return to the conference via the original portal. When shows were not in progress, [`Sage Freeman`]() designed a stunning port environment where visitors could explore and learn more information about the performances. 

OnBoardXR premiered six live performance prototypes in [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md) on March 10, 2022 for MozFest passholders before embarking on a run of shows for the general public. At this time, the portal was disabled to prevent non-ticketed attendees from entering. This successful handshake between three separate ecosystems (OnBoardXR, MozFest and Active Replica) running their own clients on their own servers provided a compeling framework for a web of disconnected 3D virtual communities chosing to allow occasional traffic to each others users and content. 

## Productions

Active Replica was often listed as a producer on one of the OnBoardXR acts each season. These prototypes recieved additional internal support from Active Replica's broader staff, often prototyping an application of live events the company wished to offer to its own client base. OnBoardXR's community and team offered equal support and services to this performances, leading to a familiar group of recurring participants. 

### This Land Is Island
[`Xriel Tarr`]() and [`Dasha Kittredge`]() were approached by [`Brendan Bradley`](./future-stages.md) to join [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md). The team partnered with [`Active Replica`]() to devise an immersive performance taking places on a deserted island with a marooned couple. The audience was prompted to choose which character they wished to follow and offer relationship advice before teaming up to defeat a Kraken, puppetted by [`Kevin Laibson`](./jettison.md). 

### Haroun Desert
[`Xriel Tarr`](), [`Dasha Kittredge`](), and [`Tyler Graham`]() submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md)

### Jazz Organ
[`Xriel Tarr`]() submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-or-registry.md)

### Parable of the Sower
MozFest engaged Active Replica to host composer and librettist, Toshi Reagon at for a short work and conversation inspired by Octavia E. Butler’s Parable of the Sower - An Opera with technical and managerial support from [`Valencia James`](./valencia-james.md) and [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md). MozFest participants could join multiple breakout rooms as a "watch party" of the live event to maximize the number of concurrent viewers in-world. After the festival, the team continued to host conversations and workshops with Toshi Reagon as low impact events to scale room capacity and multi-room broadcasting.  

### Seikuken
In the Summer of 2022, Active Replica offered its first 'Artist In Residency' program to [`Xriel Tarr`]() on the heels of his multiple OnBoardXR prototypes and his adjunct teaching at [`New York University's Lab`](./nyu-lab.md). The resulting performance *Seikuken* synthesized music, 3d animation, and user interactions with “ceremony” design by Joost Eggermont and technical and managerial operation by [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md). Proximity triggers similar to [`Strings: Prisoner`](./unwired-dance.md) and [`Pier to Peer`]() altered avatars and environment. [`Animation tables`]() built on the earlier prototypes from [`Jazz Organ`]() and [`Enough`](). 

## Staffing and Tools

OnBoardXR's community and showcases were an opportunity for Active Replica's team to train and test live event coordination and development in a low stakes environment. Many early interns or part-time employees went on to join the company full time after a few seasons of OnBoardXR, becoming proficient in asset design, stage management, ticketing, and livestreaming. During [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md), OnBoardXR organized "office hours" for Staff to unpack their process and best practices with the community which laid a foundation for Active Replica's Summer workshop series to teach creator communities.

Active Replica also sources talent for both their staffing and content needs directly from the success stories of OnBoardXR. [`Clemence Debaig`](./unwired-dance.md) was engaged to perform her [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md) prototype [`Unwanted Waters`](./unwired-dance.md) at Active Replica's official launch event. Meanwhile [`Roman Miletich`]() and [`Michael Morran`]() were offered full-time employment based on their experience developing [`cue system`](./cue-system.md) customizations and event coordation with OnBoardXR.
