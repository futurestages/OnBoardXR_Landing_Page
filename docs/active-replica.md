# Active Replica

For [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md), a Canadian immersive company, [`Active Replica`](), was introduced to the team via performer [`Xriel Tarr`]() to offer Technical support to deploy a custom client of Mozilla Hubs at XRtheater.live and Design suppport/optimization for the 3D assets. 

## Sponsorship 

Active Replica supported OnBoardXR with [In-Kind Sponsorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifts_in_kind) for [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md), [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md), and [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md). This [`"soft support"`](./glossary-soft-support.md) included maintaining XRtheater.live as a test-server for deploying webVR features or prototypes that may have disrupted Active Replica's primary business on their company server and evolving Design support to help enhance and optimize visual assets.  During [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md), Active Replica provided a 3D Lobby-Aquarium Environment, which became known as [`The Sponsor Lobby`]().

During [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md), Active Replica offered a modest fiscal sponsorhip to help cover OnBoardXR's overhead costs and allow all ticket sales to be split amoung OnBoardXR participants.

## MozFest: A Case-Study in Interoperable Metaverses

Unbeknownst to either party, [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md) applied and was accepted into Mozilla Festival (known as 'MozFest') as Active Replica was tapped to design and host the Festival's virtual campus. This campus aimed to connect multiple custom clients of Mozilla Hubs so users could "portal" between different experiences. As an case study for interoperable metaverses, MozFest granted Active Replica permission to incorporate OnBoardXR's lobby into the virtual conference itself as a dedicated "wing." Participants of the conferece could visit the OnBoardXR lobby by clicking on a doorway which linked to a [`Room`](./glossary-room.md) url on OnBoardXR's separate server. This mirrored the exact mechanic of portaling into breakout rooms in th econference itself, with the minor inconvenience of requiring the user to repeat the sign-in menu process.

During showtimes, participants could join the live performance by navigating the theater wing and clicking on the doorway. When shows were not in progress, [`Sage Freeman`]() designed a stunning port environment where visitors could explore and learn more information about the performances. OnBoardXR premieredsix prototypes in [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md) on March 10, 2022 for the MozFest passholders before embarking on a run of shows for the general public. 

## Productions

Active Replica was usually listed as a producer on one of the OnBoardXR acts each season, often the work of their long time collaborator, Xriel Tarr. These prototypes recieved additional internal support from Active Replica's broader staff, often investigating an application of live events the company wished to offer to its client base. 

### This Land Is Island
[`Xriel Tarr`]() and [`Dasha Kittredge`]() devised an immersive performance taking places on a deserted island with a marooned couple. The audience was prompted to choose which character they wished to follow and offer relationship advice before teaming up to defeat a Kraken, puppetted by Kevin Laibson. 

### Haroun Desert
[`Xriel Tarr`](), [`Dasha Kittredge`](), and [`Tyler Graham`]() 

### Jazz Organ
[`Xriel Tarr`]() 

### Parable of the Sower
MozFest engaged Active Replica to host composer and librettist, Toshi Reagon for a short work and conversation inspired by Octavia E. Butler’s Parable of the Sower - An Opera with technical and managerial support from [`Valencia James`](./valencia-james.md) [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md). 

### Seikuken
In the Summer of 2022, Active Replica offered its first 'Artist In Residency' program with Xriel Tarr. The resulting performance *Seikuken* synthesized music, 3d animation, and user interactions with “ceremony” design by Joost Eggermont and technical and managerial operation by [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md).

## Staffing and Tools

OnBoardXR's community and showcases were an opportunity for Active Replica's team to train and test live event coordination and development in a low stakes environment. Many early interns or part-time employees went on to join the company full time after a few seasons of OnBoardXR, becoming proficient in asset design, stage management, ticketing, and livestreaming. During [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md), OnBoardXR organized "office hours" for Staff to unpack their process and best practices with the community which laid a foundation for Active Replica's Summer workshop series to stage live events in the metaverse. 

OnBoardXR also provided an opportunity for Active Replica to source talent for both their staffing and content needs. [`Clemence Debaig`](./unwired-dance.md) was engaged to perform her [`OnBoardXR: Mythos & Monsters`](./obxr-mythos-monsters.md) prototype [`Unwanted Waters`](./unwired-dance.md) at Active Replica's official launch event. Meanwhile [`Roman Miletich`]() and [`Michael Morran`]() were offered full-time employment based on their experience developing [`cue system`](./cue-system.md) customizations and event coordation with OnBoardXR.
