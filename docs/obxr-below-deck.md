# OnBoardXR Season 2: 'Below Deck'
The inagural showcase of OnBoardXR, premiering March 16, 2021. Virtual attendees received a custom url allowing them freely explore several 3D environments while interacting with live performers and other attendees. A loose theme of "a virtual cruise gone awry" transitioned the audiences from a cruise ship to an underwater ship wreck to a life boat and ending on an island.

## Production & Sponsors
**The Jigsaw Ensemble, Active Replica and Agile Lens** continued their informal partnership to produce the event and absorb overhead costs for XRTHEATER.LIVE. Roman Miletitch stablized the previous [`cue system`](./glossary-cue-system.md) for triggering theatrical cues in [`web-based virtual reality`](./glossary-webvr.md). Participants submitted prototype proposals via an open-submission process which led to a mix of newcommers and return participants.

## [Cue System](./glossary-cue-system.md)
The team found it more reliable to organize all show cues under a single stage manager [`"role"`](./gloassary-role.md) rather than assign individual buttons for individual roles. As the graphic user interface for the buttons populated differently on different devices' user interface, some performers struggeled to reach or find their cue buttons while others would accidentally trigger a cue when using unrelated controller functions.
