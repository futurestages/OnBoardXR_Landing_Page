## OnBoardXR in the Press 
> *"“It’s Brendan Bradley and team’s punk rock ethos crossed with the freedom of experimentation in a new medium that keeps the mini-festival fresh and exciting…I think of OnBoardXR as a tiny fringe festival, but available in my headset. And like Forrest Gump’s box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get.”*
