## Making your own packs

Making a pack is simple. A pack is just a simple text file with a `.pack` file extension that is a list of URLs, on per line, pointing to avatar or scene URLs on any existing hub on the web. (Including your own!) Feel free to share your own packs! If you have a pack you'd like Mozilla to consider sharing, please [contact us](mailto:hubs@mozilla.com) or open a PR on our [Hubs Cloud Github Repo](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-cloud/tree/master/asset-packs).
