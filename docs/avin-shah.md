### Emcee and JAZZ ORGAN
In the Spring of 2022, [Avin Shaw]() partnered with [`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md) to devise and perform the immersive performance `Jazz Organ` for [`OnBoard: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md). 

### THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY TOO
In the beginning of 2023, Avin Shah submitted a proposal to OnBoardXR: It's Pronounced Gybe as a first exploration of his playable theatre experience for FlipsideXR.
