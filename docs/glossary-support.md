## Soft Support
As stated in our [Programming Guidelines and Protocols](https://futurestages.github.io/OnBoardXR_Landing_Page/docs/creating-a-show/#programming-guidelines-and-protocols), OnBoardXR is *not* a Producing Entity. 

OnBoardXR is a community of volunteers, many of whom are working professionals in sectors of entertainment, education and technology, often producing their own projects and products. 

OnBoardXR projects and prototypes rely on self-generative Artist who are naturally curious and motivated to bring their creative practice in virtual reality. 

This allows for maximum output and scale, often supporting over a dozen artists per fiscal quarter and leveraging community contributions to serve broad and diverse use cases. 

This also preserves ownership of creative material and property with the original Artist(s) while OnBoardXR continues to develop tools and talent that can support the future creative and storytelling economy. 

All previous [OnBoardXR Case Studies](./case-studies.md) followed this pipeline and philosophy. Many prototypes and participants have received funding, production and/or employment based on their original work with OnBoardXR.

## What does OnBoardXR offer?
Access to server space to create and host your own virtual event. 
Access to our cue-system to create and trigger theatrical effects not natively available on other platforms.
Step-by-step tutorials to create your virtual reality experience 
Access to our Private Community for mentorship, troubleshooting, inspiration and meetups.
Consideration for additional marketing and monetization opportunities. 

## Does OnBoardXR have ‘full scale’ productions? 
Occasionally, a project develops successfully and the community or one of our partners is interested in presenting the work in a larger, more formal showcase. This opportunity is only available to prototypes that have successfully presented in one of our OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcases and Artists are often approached by the interested party with a separate Producer Agreement to set and manage expectations and responsibilities.
