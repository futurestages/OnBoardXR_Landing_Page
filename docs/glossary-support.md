## Soft Support
As stated in our [Programming Guidelines and Protocols](https://futurestages.github.io/OnBoardXR_Landing_Page/docs/creating-a-show/#programming-guidelines-and-protocols), OnBoardXR is *not* a Producing Entity. 

OnBoardXR is a community of volunteers, many of whom are working professionals in sectors of entertainment, education and technology, often producing their own projects and products. 

OnBoardXR projects and prototypes rely on self-generative Artist who are naturally curious and motivated to bring their creative practice in virtual reality.
