## Dasha Kittredge
Dasha is an actor and creative director specializing in interactive storytelling. She was a live actor in [Oculus/Tender Claws' Tempest and The Under Presents](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-04-26/coronavirus-vr-virtual-reality-theater-tender-claws-live-actors) and is the lead creative director of immersive interactive experiences with [Metaforyou](https://www.metaforyou.com) whose recent clients include Amazon Prime Video, Magnolia Pictures, and Pasadena Playhouse.

In the Spring of 2021, [`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md) partnered with [`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) and [`Active Replica`]() to devise an immersive performance for [`OnBoard: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md) and was later [interviewed on Bradley's podcast for The 5th Wall Forum](https://anchor.fm/brendanabradley/episodes/Dasha-Kittredge-talks-Immersive-Weddings--Creative-Confusion--Training-for-VR--Ep20-e183bvd). Dasha is a recognized performer and creator in both the IRL and virtual immersive performance space.

### Emcee and Hosting
Since the inagural OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase, Dasha Kittredge has been one of our most frequent and recurring participants, gravitating toward our rotating group of Virtual Hosts, often greeting and helping attendees before and during the show, in character as the Pirate Emcee, `"Darrrrsha`", improvising banter and reactions to provide a loose framing for the disconnected Acts and Scenes. 

### This Land Is Island
Taking places on a deserted island with a marooned couple, the audience was prompted to choose which character they wished to follow and offer relationship advice before teaming up to defeat a kraken, puppetted by [`Kevin Laibson`](./jettison.md).

### Haroun Desert / Magid
[`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md), [`Dasha Kittredge`](), and [`Tyler Graham`](./tyler-graham.md) submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md) to expand upon a concept developed at PXR Conference, hosted by Single Thread and Electric Company Theatre. In Haroun Desert audiences encountered an unreliable protagonist [`avatar`](./glossary-avatar.md) riding an animated horse model to obscure Mozilla's half-body avatars without legs. Participants were instructed to convince another actor to give them a potion, which would ultimately give the villain-protagonist magic powers to alter his scale, summon creatures and unlock the audiences ability to 'fly.'
