## Dasha Kittredge


### This Land Is Island
[Ari Tarr](./ari-tarr.md) partnered with [Dasha Kittredge](./dasha-kittredge.md) and [`Active Replica`]() to devise an immersive performance taking places on a deserted island with a marooned couple. The audience was prompted to choose which character they wished to follow and offer relationship advice before teaming up to defeat a Kraken, puppetted by [`Kevin Laibson`](./jettison.md).

### Haroun Desert / Magid
[`Xriel Tarr`](), [`Dasha Kittredge`](), and [`Tyler Graham`]() submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md) to expand upon a concept developed at PXR Conference, hosted by Single Thread and Electric Company Theatre. In Haroun Desert audiences encountered an unreliable protagonist [`avatar`](./glossary-avatar.md) riding an animated horse model to obscure Mozilla's half-body avatars without legs. Participants were instructed to convince another actor to give them a potion, which would ultimately give the villain-protagonist magic powers to alter his scale, summon creatures and unlock the audiences ability to 'fly.'
