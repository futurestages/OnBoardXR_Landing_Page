## The Brendan Bradley Integrative Technology Lab

In 2017, New York Universityâ€™s Tisch School of the Arts launched [The Brendan Bradley Integrative Technology Lab]() as a cross-departmental initiative to invite real-world technologists as survey instructors for students to experiment with interactive and immersive technology in live performance. 

Previous OnBoardXR participants have been students or instructors at the Lab and we are always looking to engage and connect the next generation of storytellers. 

### Spring 2022
For the Spring 2022 Semester, OnBoardXR supported the Lab with equipment, resources and staffing in a dedicated course on virtual performance. 

[Michael Morran]() oversaw the course, taught by [Ari Tarr](), [Dasha Kittredge]() and [Valencia James](), hosting classes and presentations on the OnBoardXR server introducing students to 3D experience design, avatar performance and volumetric performance capture. 

### DEAN GREEN KRAKEN MACHINE

Students were also invited to participate in [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](), creating and performing DEAN GREEN KRAKEN MACHIHNE, a choose-your-own-adventure short-form experience at Mozilla Festival and monetizing their work with the general public. 

Audience members encountered a student who was being killed by student loan debt, a spell from the kraken, and called upon the audience to help save them through [live action role play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game). The audience was invited to choose different avatars which each possessed different "powers" that may help or hinder their battle with the kraken, a live performer represented as a giant avatar while puppeting animated 3d tenticle.

## Outcomes
This collaboration showcased the OnBoardXR community and tools beyond the usual 2-3 week seasonal cycle suggesting opportunity for year-round, asynchronous support and programming. These learnings directly influenced our development of [`The 21 Day Challenge`]() and outreach to future academic partners.
