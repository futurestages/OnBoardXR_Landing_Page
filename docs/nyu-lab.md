## The Brendan Bradley Integrative Technology Lab

In [2017](https://tisch.nyu.edu/drama/news/brendan-bradley-innovation-lab-creates-space-for-collaboration-a), [New York Universityâ€™s Tisch School of the Arts](https://playbill.com/article/could-nyu-have-the-solution-to-produce-distance-theatre-during-quarantine-and-beyond) launched [The Brendan Bradley Innovation Lab](https://www.americantheatre.org/2020/05/18/vr-theatre-doesnt-seem-so-distant-anymore/) as a cross-departmental initiative to invite real-world technologists as survey instructors for students to experiment with interactive and immersive technology in live performance. 

Several previous OnBoardXR participants have been students and/or instructors at the Lab and as part of our mission to engage and connect the next generation of storytellers. 

### Spring 2022
For the Spring 2022 Semester, OnBoardXR supported the Lab with equipment, resources and staffing in a dedicated course on virtual reality performance. 

[`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md) oversaw the course, taught by [`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md), [`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) and [`Valencia James`](), hosting classes and presentations on the OnBoardXR server introducing students to 3D experience design, avatar performance and volumetric performance capture. 

### OnBoardXR: Port of Registry

Students were also invited to participate in [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-of-registry.md), creating and performing DEAN GREEN KRAKEN MACHIHNE, a choose-your-own-adventure short-form experience at Mozilla Festival and monetizing their work with the general public. 

Audience members encountered a student who was being attacked by student loan debt, a spell from an evil kraken, and called upon the audience to help save them through [live action role play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game). The audience was invited to choose different avatars, each possessing different "powers" that could help or hinder their battle with the kraken, performed by a live performer represented as a giant ['avatar'](./glossary-avatar.md) while puppeting animated 3d tenticle.

## Outcomes
The NYU collaboration showcased the potential for accessing the OnBoardXR community and tools beyond the usual 2-3 week seasonal cycle suggesting opportunity for year-round, asynchronous support and programming. These learnings directly influenced the development of [`The 21 Day Challenge`](./obxr-21-day-challenge.md) and outreach to other academic partners.
