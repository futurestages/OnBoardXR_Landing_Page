# OnBoardXR Season 5: '21 Day Challenge'
In anticipation of the season, [Brendan Bradley]() began producing a series of challenge videos to allows new participants to intake and onboard themselves on their own schedule. This led to a 3X growth in Discord membership and more participants began the 21-Day-Challenge in its first month than the total number of prototpyes in the history of OnBoardXR. Unfortunately, in an effort to attract new talent and foster more community, OnBoardXR limited submissions to current students (college and graduate level) without being mindful of the end of the academic year resulting in zero applications. 

## Production & Sponsors
**The Jigsaw Ensemble** oversaw production of the 21-Day-Challenge video series with a click funnel fully integrated into Discord to step users through the 21 challege videos with unique call-to-actions to onboard themselves into OnBoardXR's community and toolkit. 

## [Cue System](./glossary-cue-system.md)
[Michael Morran]() began developing a cue building interface that would allow creators without any background or experience in coding to build their own cues on the onboardxr.live server. 

## Augmented Reality World Expo
OnBoardXR was nomintaed for the Auggie Award's Best Indie Creator and invited to present their work. [Brendan Bradley](), [Michael Morran](), [Rebecca Evans]() and [Clemence Debaig]() presented 'OnBoarding new artists and audiences into the immersive web' on Friday, June 3rd.
