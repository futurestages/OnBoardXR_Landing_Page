# OnBoardXR

Welcome to the OnBoardXR Repository for organizing and archiving documentation and case studies from our community and seasonal showcases. 

## Who is OnBoardXR for?
OnBoardXR is for live performing artists and technologists who wish to connect with others remotely in a shared virtual space. 

OnBoardXR utilizes ['web-based virtual realiity'] working across platforms without purchasing equipment or downloading software. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile devices to explore in 2D ([see supported browsers](./hubs-create-join-rooms.html#for-2d-experience)).
