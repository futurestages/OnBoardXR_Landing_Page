# Welcome to OnBoardXR

A community and seasonal first-look hackathon to educate, inspire, accelerate and empower live performing artists in the immersive web. This site is meant to organize and search documentation and case studies from OnBoardXR's community and prototypes.

## Who is OnBoardXR for?
OnBoardXR is a fleet of tools and talent supporting live performance prototpyes to onboard new artists and audiences in a shared virtual space.
