## Ari Tarr
[`Ari Tarr`]() and [`Brendan Bradley`](./brendan-bradley.md) appeared on [a panel for Theater Communications Group in June of 2020](https://youtu.be/JT0JwnLYfmY?t=2794) to discuss XR technologies in live performance. Originally concerned by the limitations of [web-based virtual reality](./webvr.md), Ari and his partners at [Active Replica](./active-replica.md) became one of OnBoardXR's most frequent early members, eventually developing their own full-format project, [Seiukuken](), from their OnBoardXR experimental prototypes to [premiere at Raindance Immersive in the Fall of 2022](https://www.raindanceimmersive.com/#/seikuken/).

### Emcee and Hosting
Since the inagural OnBoardXR Seasonal Showcase, Ari Tarr has been one of our most frequent and recurring collaborators, gravitating toward our rotating group of Virtual Hosts, often greeting and helping attendees before and during the show, in character as the Pirate Emcee, `"Codebeard"`, improvising banter and reactions to provide a loose framing for the disconnected Acts and Scenes. 

### This Land Is Island
Bradley invited Ari to join [`OnBoardXR: Cruise`](./obxr-cruise.md) in early 2021. Ari partnered with [`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md) and [`Active Replica`](./active-replica.md) to devise an immersive performance taking places on a deserted island with a marooned couple. The audience was prompted to choose which character they wished to follow and offer relationship advice before teaming up to defeat a Kraken, puppetted by [`Kevin Laibson`](./jettison.md).

### Haroun Desert / Magid
[`Ari Tarr`](), [`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md), and [`Tyler Graham`]() submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Below Deck`](./obxr-below-deck.md) to expand upon a concept developed at PXR Conference, hosted by Single Thread and Electric Company Theatre. In Haroun Desert audiences encountered an unreliable protagonist [`avatar`](./glossary-avatar.md) riding an animated horse model to obscure Mozilla's half-body avatars without legs. Participants were instructed to convince another actor to give them a potion, which would ultimately give the villain-protagonist magic powers to alter his scale, summon creatures and unlock the audiences ability to 'fly.'  

Haroun Desert was invited and included in the [`"OnBoardXR presents..." Charting The Stars`](./obxr-charting-stars.md) season for Active Replica's Constellation Project. The team re-workshopped and re-branded the story under the new name [`'Magid'`](), drawing from the creators' own culture and history.

### Jazz Organ
[`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md) submitted a proposal to [`OnBoardXR: Port of Registry`](./obxr-port-or-registry.md) to explore the potential for collaboration to repurpose a 3D artist's existing assets into an original narrative experience. Dax Norman's animated models were re-imagined as a cabaret inside the chest of the Emcee avatar, building upon earlier prototypes from [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md) for [`animation tables`](./glossary-animation-tables.md) and [`shape keys`](./glossary-shape-keys.md) that could be triggered by the [`cue system`](./cue-system.md) or the performer's vr controller.

### NYU Lab
[`Brendan Bradley`](./brendan-bradley.md) invited [`Dasha Kittredge`](./dasha-kittredge.md), Ari Tarr and [`Valencia James`](./volumetric.md) to teach a semester of his [`Integrative Technology Lab at New York University`](./nyu-lad.md) in the Spring of 2022.

### Seikuken
In the Summer of 2022, Active Replica offered its first 'Artist In Residency' program to [`Ari Tarr`](./ari-tarr.md) on the heels of his multiple OnBoardXR prototypes and his adjunct teaching at [`New York University's Lab`](./nyu-lab.md). The resulting performance *Seikuken* synthesized music, 3d animation, and user interactions with “ceremony” design by Joost Eggermont and technical and managerial operation by [`Michael Morran`](./michael-morran.md). Proximity triggers similar to [`Strings: Prisoner`](./unwired-dance.md) and [`Pier to Peer`](./peer2pier.md) altered avatars and environment. [`Animation tables`]() built on the earlier prototypes from [`Jazz Organ`]() and [`Non-Player Character`](./non-player-character.md). 

### Constellation Pilot
Ari was invited and included in the [`OnBoardXR presents..." Charting The Stars`](./obxr-charting-stars.md) season for Active Replica’s Constellation Project. He chose to reimagine Haroun Desert with [`Tyler Graham`]() under the new title, [`Magid`]() for a week of live performances.
