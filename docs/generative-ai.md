# Generative AI in Web-Based Virtual Reality
OnBoardXR first explored the application of artificial intelligence in July 2021, presenting Isak Keller's [The Play That Is Going To Change Everything](./chatgpt.md). This prototype used AI to generate an original play script, performed by actors at-keyboard, without access to VR equipment. For the May 2023 showcase, Michael Morran and Clemence Debaig began integrating artificial intelligence APIs directly into the [cue system](./cue-system.md) to allow performers and audience to generate assets in the virtual world in real-time as part of a live storytelling experience.
